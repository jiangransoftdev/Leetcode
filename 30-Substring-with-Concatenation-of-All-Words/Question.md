# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

You are given a string, **s**, and a list of words, **words**, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without any intervening characters.

For example, given:  
**s**: `"barfoothefoobarman"`  
**words**: `["foo", "bar"]`

You should return the indices: `[0,9]`.  
(order does not matter).
